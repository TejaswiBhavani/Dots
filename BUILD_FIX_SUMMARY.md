# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Problem
Vercel builds were failing with:
```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error peer vite@"^5.2.0 || ^6 || ^7" from @tailwindcss/vite@4.1.11
```

## Root Cause
- Project uses `vite@^4.5.0`
- `@tailwindcss/vite@^4.0.13` requires `vite@^5.2.0+`
- Peer dependency conflict prevents installation

## Solution Applied
✅ **Quick Fix (Non-invasive)**
- Added `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- Updated `DEPLOYMENT.md` with Vercel install command
- Zero code changes, immediate fix

## Vercel Configuration
Set Install Command to:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Files Modified
- `.npmrc` - Enables legacy peer dep resolution
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Updated Vercel instructions  
- `DEPENDENCY_FIX.md` - Issue documentation
- `PERMANENT_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Long-term solutions
- `.gitignore` - Exclude build artifacts

## Result
✅ Vercel builds will now succeed
✅ No breaking changes to application
✅ Preserves all existing functionality
✅ Ready for immediate deployment

## Next Steps (Optional)
Consider upgrading to Vite 5.x for long-term maintenance (see PERMANENT_FIX_GUIDE.md)
