# Permanent Fix for Dependency Conflicts

## Option A: Upgrade Vite to v5 (Recommended)

This approach resolves the root cause by upgrading Vite to a version compatible with @tailwindcss/vite.

### Changes Required:

**package.json**:
```diff
   "devDependencies": {
-    "vite": "^4.5.0",
+    "vite": "^5.4.0",
     "vite-tsconfig-paths": "^5.1.4",
```

### Verification Steps:
1. Remove `.npmrc` (no longer needed)
2. Update package.json as shown above
3. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
4. Run `npm install` (without --legacy-peer-deps)
5. Run `npm run build`
6. Test the application thoroughly

### Compatibility Check:
- Astro ^5.8.0 supports Vite 5.x
- @astrojs/react ^4.2.3 is compatible with Vite 5.x
- @tailwindcss/vite ^4.0.13 requires Vite 5.2.0+

### Potential Issues:
- Some Vite plugins may need updates
- Build configuration might need adjustments
- ESM handling could differ slightly

## Option B: Remove @tailwindcss/vite Plugin

This approach removes the problematic plugin and uses standard PostCSS integration.

### Changes Required:

**package.json**:
```diff
   "dependencies": {
-    "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.0.13",
+    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.16",
     "@wix/astro": "1.0.29",
```

**astro.config.mjs**:
```diff
 import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
 import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";
-import { tailwindcss } from "@tailwindcss/vite";

 export default defineConfig({
   integrations: [
     tailwind(),
   ],
   vite: {
     plugins: [
       customErrorOverlayPlugin(),
-      tailwindcss(),
       ...(isBuild ? [nodePolyfills()] : []),
     ],
   },
```

**postcss.config.mjs** (create if not exists):
```javascript
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### Benefits:
- Keeps Vite 4.x
- Standard Tailwind integration
- Fewer moving parts
- Well-established approach

## Recommended Approach

**For immediate deployment**: Use the current `.npmrc` fix
**For long-term maintenance**: Implement Option A (Vite upgrade) as it addresses the root cause and keeps the modern toolchain.

The Vite upgrade is recommended because:
1. Astro 5.x officially supports Vite 5.x
2. Vite 5.x has better performance and features
3. It aligns with the ecosystem's direction
4. @tailwindcss/vite provides better HMR and optimization
